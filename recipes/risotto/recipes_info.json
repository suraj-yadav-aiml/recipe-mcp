Keep stirring until the rice is tender\r\nSeason with the lemon juice and zest, and pepper to taste. (there will probably be sufficient saltiness from the salmon to not need to add salt) Stir gently to heat through\r\nServe scattered with the Parmesan and seasonal vegetables.\r\nGrill the salmon and gently place onto the risotto with the prawns and asparagus",
